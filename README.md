# 🚀 PMD Python Library (pmd-pylibrary)

Welcome!
This project is my **personal Python library** to help me learn and grow in the world of **Data Analytics** using Python. I created this with **limited laptop resources (Mac M3 8GB)** — so I focus on **lightweight, fast, and memory-efficient tools**, inspired by the **Rust programming language**.

I use **Polars** instead of only Pandas, and I apply **Rust principles** (like dropping unused memory and chaining) to make my code **cleaner and faster**.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Easy Data Exploration, even on low-RAM laptops
- 🚀 Built using Polars (Rust backend), with Pandas support
- 🧠 Learn by doing: each tool is simple but powerful
- 📦 Modular design, for clean and reusable code

## 💡 Why I Built This

**I want to**:

- Learn Python data tools the smart way
- Keep my RAM usage low while exploring big data
- Combine Rust ideas (like .drop(), .with_context(), .chain()) into Python classes
- Build tools that are simple to use, and help me grow faster

## 🔗 Next Steps

    •	📊 Add support for charting/visuals with Plotly or Altair
    •	☁️ Explore saving/exporting data to the cloud
    •	🤖 Add basic ML workflows step-by-step
